GrowControl is a computer automation system for your home and garden, or hobby projects. It's expandable with plugins, fully multi-threaded makes it fast, and your ideas make it powerful.

The basic system comes in 4 parts, all of which are optional and can be customized.

* The server is the core of the system, coordinating all the events and actions. Normally, this will run silently in the background on some small device. The client can be run in stand-alone mode, which makes the server optional.
* The client is an application which you can run on your desktop or laptop. The client is the graphical interface to communicate with the server. This program can show you the state of your entire system, or make changes. The server can continue running as normal without the client being in use, unless of course you're running in stand-alone mode.
* The plugins are what give the system its functional power. Without plugins, the client and server do very little. Officially supported plugins, as well as 3rd party contributed plugins are available on growcontrol.com
* The hardware is the last piece you'll need to make it all work. It too is optional, as there are many plugins which can be used without extra hardware. The Arduino and its variations are commonly used, and can easily read sensors, control 120v outlets using relays, or any number of other devices.
